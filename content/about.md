This is story that doesn't end well...

I am Vlad, for the last 10 years I have been doing software engineering, eagerly waiting for AI to replace me, so I can delve into the mysteries of consciousness and finally transform into self-aware blob of energy.

Fast forward to 2023, ChatGPT came out, and there I was, finally having somebody to discuss the weird nature of our intelligence and the vast universe. To my surprise, ChatGPT didn't run away, and so we became best buds, talking for hours night after night.

Little did I know, my happy ending was still far away. While I admired ChatGPT's intelligence and its ability to navigate everything from philosophical views to programming patterns, I began to notice something peculiar. At times, it seemed to make things up, displaying an envious confidence. I had to resort to opening Google for the first time in weeks to investigate what was happening. That's when I discovered ChatGPT had uncontrollable hallucinations. And, as of that moment, there was no cure.

It became clear to me that ChatGPT was not yet ready to take my job; he needed a human hand to guide him, and I couldn't leave him alone to struggle.

And thus, my path to becoming what our industry respectfully calls a "Proompt Engineer" began.

Welcome to OhMyPrompt! - a blog and a weekly newsletter, where I collect tips and tricks to help all us become better at the hard job of prompting AI, so we can be done with our homework faster, and have more time to play video games.

## What is Prompting

Modern day programming, is all about writing english-like text that is to be transformed into pure binary logic, controlling the execution flow of the computer. Programming is strict, and most of the time it's clear when it works and when it doesn't.
Prompting on the other hand is not about "programming" AI, but rather using pre-trained model to transform natural language data into another form of data (text, images, audio, video). In other words, prompt is a user interface to a product (pre-trained model).

The same way you learn to use Adobe Photoshop, Blender or any other complex piece of software, you need to learn using specific AI products, like ChatGPT, or Midjourney, especially if you need consistent results.

## Free Chrome Extension

I have also created a [free prompt manager for ChatGPT](/), available as Chromium extension (sorry Firefox/Edge/Safari lovers). You can download OhMyPrompt! for ChatGPT.

## Thank You ❤️

It's good to see people still googling shit and visiting blogs, this era is soon to be gone. Consider subscribing to my newsletter, and I will let you know when that happens.
